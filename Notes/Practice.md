# Practice Questions

> Focus on the physics of the javascript canvas library

# Learning Method

- Run through the code and explain it verbally (focus on making understanding programs accessible)
- Experiment with changing values and making hypotheses
- Make a slight variation (useful but not too useful)

---

# Goals

1. Learn to draw objects
2. Learn to move objects
3. Learn to collide objects (interaction included - such as pull / push force)
4. Learn to user control objects and gameflow
5. Learn to build environments
6. Learn to build classes
7. Add color and texture

# Draw

- Draw a rectangle
- Draw a circle
- Draw a triangle
- Draw lines
- Draw points on a line
- Change canvas dimensions
- Grow or reduce objects over time

# Move

- Move object sides to sides
- Move objects straight lines
- Move objects at an angle
- Change object speed and momentum
- Let objects move around a circle
- Let objects spin
- Let objects wobble

# Collide

- Collide with walls
- Collide with each other
- Change behaviour based on where the objects are
- Collide with other objects

# Environment interaction

- Environment changes based on objects
- Environment changes over time

# User control

- Keyboard
- Mouse

# Game parameters

- Score
- Pause
- Save scoreboard
- Add sounds
