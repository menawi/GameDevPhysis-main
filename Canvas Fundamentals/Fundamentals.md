To develop games using JavaScript Canvas, you should master the following fundamental skills:

Drawing shapes: You should be able to draw basic shapes such as rectangles, circles, and lines using Canvas API.

Manipulating pixels: You should understand how to manipulate individual pixels on the Canvas to create complex visuals and effects.

Animating objects: You should be able to use the requestAnimationFrame method to create smooth and efficient animations.

Handling user input: You should understand how to capture and respond to user input such as mouse clicks and keyboard presses.

Implementing collision detection: You should be able to detect when objects in your game collide and respond appropriately.

Implementing game loops: You should understand how to create a game loop that updates and redraws the Canvas on each iteration.

Loading and manipulating images: You should be able to load and manipulate images on the Canvas to create more complex game graphics.

By mastering these skills, you'll be able to create simple to moderately complex games using JavaScript Canvas.


```javascript
context.strokeStyle = "#00FF00";
context.lineWidth = 0.25


for (let x = 0; x < canvas.width; x += 10) {
  context.moveTo(x, 0);
  context.lineTo(x, canvas.height);
}

for (let y = 0; y < canvas.height; y += 10) {
  context.moveTo(0, y);
  context.lineTo(canvas.width, y);
}

context.stroke();

```
